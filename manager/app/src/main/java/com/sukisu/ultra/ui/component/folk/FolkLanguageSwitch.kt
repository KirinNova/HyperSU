/**
 * The page shown while a language switch is applied: the app's own loader, with
 * its label written in the language being switched to.
 *
 * Two things about what a language switch actually does shape this:
 *
 * - The switch recreates the activity, so this has to *replace* the app content
 *   rather than cover it. The frame the new activity draws first must be this
 *   page, or the work spent composing the rest of the app is spent on a frame
 *   nobody sees.
 * - The label is read from the activity's own resources, which carry the new
 *   language only once the switch has been applied. Until then the page is drawn
 *   with the loader alone - showing the text now would show it in the language
 *   the user is leaving, which is exactly the wrong answer.
 *
 * What this page cannot cover is the system's starting window: the recreation
 * replays the splash screen, and that window belongs to the system. Its colour
 * is themed to the app background (`windowSplashScreenBackground`) so it reads
 * as this page rather than as a black flash.
