A kernel-based root solution for Android devices, forked from [`SukiSU-Ultra/SukiSU-Ultra`](https://github.com/SukiSU-Ultra/SukiSU-Ultra), which is forked from [`tiann/KernelSU`](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU), and added some interesting changes.

## Features

1. Kernel-based `su` and root access management
2. [App Profile](https://kernelsu.org/guide/app-profile.html): Lock up the root power in a cage
3. Support non-GKI and GKI 1.0
4. KPM Support
5. Tweaks to the manager theme and the built-in susfs management tool.

## Compatibility Status

- KernelSU (before v1.0.0) officially supports Android GKI 2.0 devices (kernel 5.10+).

- Older kernels (4.4+) are also compatible, but the kernel will have to be built manually.

- With more backports, KernelSU can supports 3.x kernel (3.4-3.18).

- Currently, only `arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a (bare)` and `X86_64`(some) are supported.

## Installation

See [`guide/installation.md`](guide/installation.md)

## Integration

See [`guide/how-to-integrate.md`](guide/how-to-integrate.md)

## Translation

If you need to submit a translation for the manager, please open a pull request on GitHub.

## KPM Support

- Based on KernelPatch, we removed features redundant with KSU and retained only KPM support.
- Work in Progress: Expanding APatch compatibility by integrating additional functions to ensure compatibility across different implementations.

**Open-source repository**: [https://github.com/ShirkNeko/SukiSU_KernelPatch_patch](https://github.com/ShirkNeko/SukiSU_KernelPatch_patch)

**KPM template**: [https://github.com/udochina/KPM-Build-Anywhere](https://github.com/udochina/KPM-Build-Anywhere)

> [!Note]
>
> 1. Requires `CONFIG_KPM=y`
> 2. Non-GKI devices requires `CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y` and `CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL=y`
> 3. For kernels below `4.19`, backporting from `set_memory.h` from `4.19` is required.
